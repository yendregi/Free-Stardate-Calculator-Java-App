# StarDateWidget
A Java StarDate Trek Themed TaskBar Widget 

## WHY?
Firstly, I will ask the question for you fine reader; why this application?
Well, I needed a way to mark down particular date/times with a positively increasing number that can mapped back to a particular event.
For instance: suppose with each code checkin we want to capture a unique identifier ... well, with the stardate widget I can capture a 
positively increasing number such as '71356.901' and I can now stamp whatever record with that number which represents the date/time : 'Tue Nov 21 19:36:00 PST 2017'

## What does the UI looks like ?
The widget sits in your task bar such as :
<windows img>, <linux img>, <mac imc>


## So how do I run it ?
a. download this repository either by git or simply the download button
b. you can either build the entire app from scratch with apache ant and run the build.xml to generate the current release or use the executables under CaptainStarDateCalculator/release_71351.052_jdk_1.8
to run the application.
Under Windows: execute the run.bat
Under Linux: execute the run.sh through a terminal... or simply 'java -jar CaptainsStarDate.jar'
Under Mac: it's simple enough to double click the jar file, however you'll be presented with a security check saying the application publisher can't be authenticated, hence, you have to go to preference > privacy & security and enable the jar file to run:
![mac security 1](CaptainStarDateCalculator/docs/imgs/Mac_Security_P1.png)
Once you have accepted the 'Open Anyway' button, you'll lastly be present with the last warning:
![mac security 1](CaptainStarDateCalculator/docs/imgs/Mac_Security_P2.png)
Post hitting the 'Open' button you'll be able to run this app/jar anytime !
